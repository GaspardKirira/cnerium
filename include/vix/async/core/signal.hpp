   * @brief Asynchronous POSIX signal watcher integrated with io_context.

   * signal_set provides a small signal-watching facility that:
   * - allows registering a set of signal numbers (add/remove)
   * - supports awaiting the next signal via async_wait()
   * - optionally invokes a callback on each received signal
   * - posts completions back onto the io_context scheduler
   *
   * Internally, it may start a dedicated worker thread on first use
   * (lazy startup) to observe signals and dispatch events safely.
   *
   * @note Exact signal delivery semantics depend on platform rules and
   * process/thread signal masks. This API is designed to integrate with
   * Vix async tasks and cancellation.
